HTMLhouse uses [ACE editor](https://ace.c9.io/) for modifying HTML and shows a live preview of what you've created in an `iframe` alongside the source code.

No user signup is required -- authorization to modify an individual published page is saved on the creator's device in local storage as an ID and [JWT](http://jwt.io/) generated by the server.

It is also available as an [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abunchtell.htmlhouse) app.

## Development

### Requirements

* Go
* Node.js
* MySQL

### Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `go get -d` to get necessary dependencies
3. Run `make install` to install LESS compiler locally and generate the CSS files
4. Run the queries in `init.sql` to set up the database
5. _Optional_. Run `./keys.sh prod` to create a new keypair

### Running the server

* Run `go run cmd/htmlhouse/main.go` in the top level directory, optionally by creating a simple run script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

DB_USER=dbuser DB_PASSWORD=pass DB_DB=htmlhouse PRIVATE_KEY=keys/dev PUBLIC_KEY=keys/dev.pub go run main/main.go
```
* Open your browser to http://localhost:8080

**When to reload the app**. If you change any of the templates in `templates/` or any `.go` file, you'll need to re-run the app.
